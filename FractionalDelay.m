% a) a[n] = sin((k/M-n)*pi)/(k/M-n)/pi
% b) IFTD(exp(-j*k*theta)) = sin((k-n)*pi)/(k-n)/pi = delta[n-k]
% c) H should be a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of pi/M.
% A practical issue is that the sample domain will have infinitely many
% non-zero coefficients. Another issue is that the filter is non-causal.
